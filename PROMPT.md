## Design Direction

### Aesthetic
Swiss Editorial - Clean, precise, confident. Inspired by Swiss design principles with editorial magazine touches.

### Typography
- Display: Instrument Sans (distinctive geometric sans, modern tech feel)
- Body: System font stack for performance, or Instrument Sans throughout

### Color Palette
- Background: `#fafafa` (warm off-white)
- Surface: `#ffffff` (pure white for cards)
- Columns: `#f3f3f3` (subtle gray)
- Text: `#111111` (near-black)
- Muted: `#6b7280` (gray-500)
- Accent: `#111111` (black for interactive elements)
- Warning: `#fef3c7` / `#f59e0b` (amber for storage banner)

### Signature Elements
- Subtle 1px borders with refined shadows
- Smooth 200ms transitions on interactions
- Generous whitespace, precise alignment
- Monospace accents for counts/metadata

## Philosophy
KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid. No over-engineering, no unnecessary features. Local-first, privacy-respecting, fast.
